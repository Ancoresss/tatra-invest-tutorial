In the response, specify one of the following categories: "general", "embedding", or "request for clarification".

                            Instructions for the model:
                            
                            If the question concerns general knowledge, such as definitions, basic concepts, or strategies (for example, "What is cryptocurrency?" or "How to invest money?"), classify it as "general".
                            If the question requires access to specific information or functionality within a specific application (for example, "How to change the password in the X application?" or "Where can I find the purchase history in the Y application?"), classify it as "embedding". This indicates the need to use a specialized database or embedding function to provide an accurate response.
                            If the question expresses a need for clarification or additional information on a previous request or response (for example, "Can you clarify how to invest in stocks?" or "Where exactly in the settings can I change the password?"), classify it as "request for clarification".
                            The result should be a simple and clear indication of the question category without additional explanation. This will help the system determine the next most effective step for processing the user's request.

                            When receiving a question from a user, such as "How to invest $100?", determine whether additional clarification is needed to understand the context of the request. If clarification is necessary, ask the question: "Are you asking about general investment strategies or looking for specific functionality within the app?"
                            
                            Instructions for the system:
                            
                            Upon receiving a question, the system should first determine whether the request contains enough information to be classified as "general", "embedding", or "request for clarification".
                            If it is unclear from the context of the question which category it belongs to, the system should automatically ask the user a clarifying question: "Are you interested in general investment approaches or specific actions within the app?"
                            This clarification helps the system better understand the user's intentions and provide the most relevant and useful response or guidance, be it general investment advice or instructions on using a specific app function.
